# Quarto Demo

Use `quarto` to produce a professional report.

This side project was done in the CAPE, Confidential Analysis Privacy Enhancement, team at the NICS (National Institute of Cyber Security).

To render the pdf, you should download [quarto](https://quarto.org/) and install tinytex via `quarto install tinytex`.

The result can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Alexchen666/quarto-demo/blob/main/report.pdf). You can use this example to produce synthetic data evaluation report automatically by entering original and synthetic dataset name (datasets should be in the same directory of course).
